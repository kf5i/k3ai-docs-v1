# Hello-Start

## What I will learn?

Let start with the basics. Here's how we structured the examples section:

**Hello-Earth**: this is the first step. We will teach you how to create a basic pipeline with [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/)

**Hello-World**: this is the second step. Let's introduce some more concepts, like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) up to the full [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/)

**Hello-Universe**: this is the third step. After building a pipeline, and learning to write and train a model, we move on to the inference server side. Here you'll learn to interact with the model serving use cases

**Hello-All**: this is the final step. Let's add a mini web-app and create an end-to-end scenario in order to see our results live!

# Quick Start

## First things First

Start by installing K3Ai from the **STABLE** channel with this:

```text
curl -sfL https://get.k3ai.in | bash -
```

if you feel brave you may test our **EDGE** channel

### **on Linux**

```text
curl -sfL https://get-core.k3ai.in | bash -
```

### **on Windows**

```text
. { iwr -useb https://get-core.k3ai.in  } | iex;
```

### **Note: sometimes things take longer than expected resulting in the error below:**

```text
error: timed out waiting for the condition on xxxxxxx
```

Don't worry! Sometimes the installation takes a few minutes, especially the Vagrant version or if you have limited bandwidth.

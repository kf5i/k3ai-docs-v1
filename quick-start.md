# Quick Start

## First things First

Start by installing K3Ai from the **V1** channel with this:

```text
curl -sfL https://get.k3ai.in | bash -
```

### **Note: sometimes things take longer than expected resulting in the error below:**

```text
error: timed out waiting for the condition on xxxxxxx
```

Don't worry! Sometimes the installation takes a few minutes, especially the Vagrant version or if you have limited bandwidth.

Still curious? Here's a short demo:
